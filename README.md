# Olympic Medal Prediction Project

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict the number of medals Olympic teams will win based on historical data. The project is implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Files Included

- **Olympic_ML_Model.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook where the data is cleaned and the model is trained.
- **teams.csv**: The dataset used to train the model.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the project:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
```
You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Instructions

1.) Download the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2.) Open Jupyter Notebook in the project directory.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
3.) In Jupyter Notebook, open the Olympic_ML_Model.ipynb file. This notebook contains all the steps for data cleaning, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Python. The steps involved include:

1.) Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data in teams.csv to make it suitable for training.

2.) Model Training: Creating a multivariate linear regression model to predict the number of medals.

3.) Model Evaluation: Using mean absolute error to evaluate the model's performance.

### Future Enhancements

- Adding More Predictors: Including additional features to improve the model's accuracy.
- Using Random Forest: Exploring the use of random forest for better performance compared to linear regression.
